    # Teleport-Mode can be 'height_limit_tp' or 'ground_tp'

    # Explanations:
    # 'ground_tp':
    #      Can only be used if the area selected is pre-generated
    #      Otherwise it will throw exceptions
    #
    # 'height_limit_tp':
    #      Will apply resistance 100 for 300 ticks to prevent fall damage
    #      Works if the terrain is not pre-generated
    #      Didn't really need to be implemented but incase you'd want to use it on
    #      maps that arent pre-generated
